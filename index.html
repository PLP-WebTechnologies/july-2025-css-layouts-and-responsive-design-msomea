            <h2>Japanese Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Japan is a country steeped in tradition and modernity, where ancient customs coexist with cutting-edge technology. Japanese culture is deeply influenced by Shintoism and Buddhism, which have shaped the country’s festivals, rituals, and everyday practices. One of the most recognizable aspects of Japanese culture is its emphasis on harmony and respect. Politeness is deeply ingrained, and the Japanese language reflects this through honorifics and formal speech. Bowing is a traditional form of greeting, showing respect to others in both social and professional contexts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The arts are a significant part of Japanese culture. Traditional practices like tea ceremonies, ikebana (flower arranging), and calligraphy emphasize patience, attention to detail, and a connection with nature. Japanese gardens are meticulously designed to reflect natural landscapes in miniature, offering spaces for meditation and reflection.
